# Energy Efficiency Analysis – Manufacturing BI Dashboard

## 📌 Business Problem
Manufacturing operations show increasing energy consumption and long processing times. 
The objective is to identify inefficiency drivers and quantify their impact.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify which processes drive energy consumption
- Analyze efficiency categories (Low, Moderate, High, Optimal)
- Detect machines contributing most to inefficiency
- Provide actionable KPIs for decision makers

## 📊 KPIs
- Total Energy Consumption (kWh)
- Total Processing Time (hours)
- Energy Intensity (kWh/hour)
- % Energy from Low Efficiency
- % Completed Jobs under Low Efficiency
- Machine Contribution to Inefficiency

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Low Efficiency processes account for **65% of total energy consumption**
- Energy consumption increases disproportionately with processing time under Low Efficiency
- Machines **M01 and M02** concentrate the highest energy usage
- 48% of completed jobs operate under Low Efficiency conditions

## 🛠 Tools
- Power BI
- DAX
- Data Modeling
- Business Intelligence Best Practices
